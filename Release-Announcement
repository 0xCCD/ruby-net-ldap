We're pleased to announce version 0.0.2 of Net::LDAP, the first
pure-Ruby LDAP library. Net::LDAP intends to be a feature-complete
LDAP client which can access as much as possible of the functionality
of the most-used LDAP server implementations. This library does
not wrap any existing native-code LDAP libraries, creates no
Ruby extensions, and has no dependencies external to Ruby.

Version 0.0.2 includes an implementation of the "paged search
control" to enable queries of A/D result sets > 1000 entries.
It also fills in some holes in the documentation.

And finally we fixed the annoying problem that the 0.0.1 gem
and tarball had trailing garbage. Thanks to Austin for helping
track that down.

= What is Net::LDAP for Ruby?
This library provides a pure-Ruby implementation of an LDAP client.
It can be used to access any server which implements the LDAP protocol.

Net::LDAP is intended to provide full LDAP functionality while hiding
the more arcane aspects of the LDAP protocol itself, so as to make the
programming interface as Ruby-like as possible.

In particular, this means that there is no direct dependence on the
structure of the various "traditional" LDAP clients. This is a ground-up
rethinking of the LDAP API.

Net::LDAP is based on RFC-1777, which specifies the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol, as amended and extended by subsequent RFCs and by the more
widely-used directory implementations.

== LICENCE NOTES
Please read the file LICENCE for licensing restrictions on this library. In
the simplest terms, this library is available under the same terms as Ruby
itself.

== Requirements and Installation
Net::LDAP requires Ruby 1.8.2 or better.

Net::LDAP can be installed with:

 % ruby setup.rb

Alternatively, you can use the RubyGems version of Net::LDAP available
as ruby-net-ldap-0.0.1.gem from the usual sources.

== Whet your appetite:
    require 'net/ldap'
    
    ldap = Net::LDAP.new :host => server_ip_address,
         :port => 389,
         :auth => {
               :method => :simple,
               :username => "cn=manager,dc=example,dc=com",
               :password => "opensesame"
         }
  
    filter = Net::LDAP::Filter.eq( "cn", "George*" )
    treebase = "dc=example,dc=com"
    
    ldap.search( :base => treebase, :filter => filter ) do |entry|
      puts "DN: #{entry.dn}"
      entry.each do |attribute, values|
        puts "   #{attribute}:"
        values.each do |value|
          puts "      --->#{value}"
        end
      end
    end
    
    p ldap.get_operation_result
